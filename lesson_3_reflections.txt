Q When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A When other people need to contribute to the code or working within teams on a project

Q Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A You may not always want all of the changes depictated in a particular file. And sometimes you may not want to store changes or branches locally as they are not relevant to you or your local work.
